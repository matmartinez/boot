# Boot

Boot is like the good ol’ _Goodies Disk_ that came with early Macintosh computers. For your Terminal. Only a fraction of fun.


## What it does

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (if needed).
2. Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install) (if needed).
3. Install Boot to `.zshrc` so to get some neat built-in scripts and aliases.

## Getting started

First, clone this repository to a permanent location of your liking on your hard drive. Maybe `~/Developer`? It looks really good on the Finder.

```sh
mkcd ~/Developer
git clone https://github.com/matmartinez/boot
cd boot
```

Then run the install script:

```sh
source boot_install.sh
```

You’re done.
